Wall painting of the incident in Gaza
Wall painting of the incident in Gaza
The killing of Muhammad al-Durrah took place in the Gaza Strip on 30 September 2000, during the widespread protests and riots of the Second Intifada. Jamal al-Durrah and his 12-year-old son Muhammad were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian television cameraman freelancing for France 2, as the two were caught in crossfire between Israeli and Palestinian forces. The footage shows the pair crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust, with the boy slumping over. Some of the footage was broadcast in France with a voiceover from Charles Enderlin, who told viewers that the al-Durrahs had been the target of Israeli fire, killing the boy. This interpretation has been questioned by critics and by the Israel Defense Forces, which retracted an initial apology. After an emotional public funeral, Muhammad was hailed throughout the Muslim world as a martyr, with the scene appearing on postage stamps. (Full article...)

Georges Ernest Boulanger	
Georges Ernest Boulanger (29 April 1837 – 30 September 1891), nicknamed Général Revanche, was a French general and politician. An enormously popular public figure during the Third Republic, he won a series of elections and was feared to be powerful enough to establish himself as dictator at the zenith of his popularity in January 1889. This photograph of Boulanger was produced by the atelier of the French photographer Nadar.
